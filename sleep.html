      <h2>Sleep Stages Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Human sleep is traditionally divided into multiple stages, each serving
        a critical biological and neurological function. WakeWell monitors these
        stages to ensure healthy sleep continuity and timely awakening.
      </p>

      <h3>Non-REM Sleep</h3>
      <p>
        Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep consists of progressively deeper
        stages of rest. During this period, brain activity slows, muscle tension
        decreases, and external awareness is reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        These stages are considered stable and self-limiting under normal
        conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>REM Sleep</h3>
      <p>
        Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is associated with vivid dreaming,
        increased brain activity, and temporary muscle paralysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        REM stages are expected to occur cyclically and resolve without
        conscious intervention.
      </p>

      <h3>Observational Notes</h3>
      <p>
        Recent internal observations indicate that extended REM exposure may
        result in heightened environmental continuity within dream states.
      </p>
      <p>
        In isolated cases, subjects have reported difficulty distinguishing
        between dream environments and waking memory.
      </p>

      <h3>Advisory Notice</h3>
      <p>
        If you experience recurring locations, repeated interactions, or
        prolonged awareness during sleep, WakeWell recommends maintaining a
        consistent waking routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid intentional sleep deepening techniques unless supervised by a
        qualified specialist.
