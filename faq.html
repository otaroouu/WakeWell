      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is it normal to feel aware while dreaming?</h3>
      <p>
        Some individuals experience increased awareness during certain sleep
        stages. This does not indicate risk and typically resolves without
        intervention.
      </p>

      <h3>Why do some dreams feel familiar?</h3>
      <p>
        The brain often reuses known environments and memories during sleep.
        Familiarity alone should not be considered unusual.
      </p>

      <h3>What if my dreams feel continuous?</h3>
      <p>
        Perceived continuity may occur when sleep cycles are disrupted.
        Maintaining a regular sleep schedule is strongly advised.
      </p>

      <h3>I feel like I stayed somewhere for a long time. Is that possible?</h3>
      <p>
        Time perception during sleep is subjective. Extended duration is not
        physically measurable and should not be interpreted literally.
      </p>

      <h3>What should I do if I feel disoriented after waking?</h3>
      <p>
        Mild disorientation can occur. If symptoms persist, avoid sleep
        journaling or memory recall exercises without professional guidance.
      </p>

      <h3>Why does WakeWell study this?</h3>
      <p>
        WakeWell is dedicated to public sleep safety and the prevention of
        abnormal sleep-state prolongation events.
